# 🔐 Blockchain Identity Security System

A production-ready identity security system using MERN stack and Blockchain.

## 📌 Problem
Traditional identity systems store sensitive data on centralized servers, making them vulnerable to data breaches and tampering.

## 💡 Solution
This project secures identity documents by:
- Encrypting identity data
- Storing data off-chain
- Storing only cryptographic hash on blockchain for verification

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: MongoDB
- Blockchain: Ethereum (Smart Contracts)
- Security: AES Encryption, SHA-256 Hashing

## 🚧 Project Status
Initial project setup completed.
Frontend, backend, and blockchain modules will be developed step-by-step.
